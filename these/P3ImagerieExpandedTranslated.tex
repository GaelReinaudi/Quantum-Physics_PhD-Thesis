When handling cold atoms, it is essential to characterize the atomic ensembles brought into play
Physical quantities which we have access are most often:
* The number of atoms,
* The spatial distribution of atoms in the cloud
* The velocity distribution,
* Density in phase space to a particle.

Techniques to acquire this information is almost entirely optical in nature, that is to say, based on processes of absorption, distribution, or phase of a light wave.

In this chapter, we will describe the two main methods commonly used to produce images of ultra-cold atomic ensembles: fluorescence imaging and imaging absorption in the low saturation regime. Limitations of these methods when it comes to produce images of dense clouds, will lead us to look at more advanced techniques, but more complex to implement.
Finally, we present a new imaging protocol that we have developed during my second year of PhD. This solves the atomic structures of dense clouds and gives access to precise and quantitative measurements.


/ / / / Imaging a cold atomic ensemble / / / /

In this section, we describe an optical minimum, we will introduce the concepts necessary to study the imaging of an atomic ensemble. We will focus on the nature of digital information obtained when taking a picture. Laser-atom interactions are also described, since the equations arising allow use in quantitative data contained in an image.


/ / / / / / / / Optics / / / / / / / /

To focus our attention on the principle of imaging methods, we will consider the system as simple as possible neglecting the imperfections of optical components. We will assume in the context of the Gauss approximation.
The optical axis is taken as the z axis aaaaq bbbbq.
The figureCCCnrefBrrrrofig: SytemeOptiqueBrrrrc represents a simple optical system for producing the image of the atom cloud on a CCD sensor comprised of a matrix of pixels. We can measure the light intensity distribution aaaaq CCCIxy bbbbq from the object plane.

Brrrrc




In the sequel, we will consider an atomic cloud whose density is denoted atomic aaaaq CCCdensxyz bbbbq. This cloud is located at the object plane of the optical system, and we assume that each point aaaaq CCCxyz bbbbq cloud has a point image aaaaq (x ', y') bbbbq on the CCD.
This implies that the system is not sensitive to the position z aaaaq bbbbq atoms, but only to their position aaaaq CCCxy bbbbq projected on the object plane.

This corresponds to the surface density of atoms if the cloud was projected onto the plane aaaaq CCCxy bbbbq. Obtain an image of the cloud is to measure this variable.
Brrrrc
It is clear that the knowledge of the density column aaaaq CCCdenscolxy bbbbq not enough to determine the atomic density aaaaq CCCdensxyz bbbbq the cloud. This ambiguity of the measure can be lifted by assuming that the cloud has certain symmetries.

/ / / / / / / / / / / / Spatial sampling / / / / / / / / / / / /

The finite number of pixels on the sensor sets a limit on the spatial accuracy of the signal supplied by the CCD. This is called spatial sampling (also referred to as pixelation). For conventional CCD sensors, the size of a pixel is typically of the order of aaaaq CCCLpix = CCCmicronBrrrro5Brrrrc bbbbq. This limitation should be taken into account when we want to make images of atomic ensembles whose spatial extension is very low (typically less than CCCmicronBrrrro100Brrrrc). The optical system will then be designed so as to provide a magnified image of the cloud on the sensor.

Unless otherwise stated, the laser system that we will consider in the following is shown schematically in figureCCCnrefBrrrrofig: SystemeLaserBrrrrc.
We can produce light pulses whose duration aaaaq CCCTPulse bbbbq and power aaaaq CCCPLaser bbbbq are precisely controlled. The shortest pulses that we use with our system have a period aaaaq CCCTPulse = CCCnanosBrrrro250Brrrrc bbbbq.

Frequency fluctuations thus obtained should be very small compared to the natural linewidth of aaaaq CCCpulsSpont bbbbq aaaaq POOOOOBrrrro87Brrrrc bbbbqRb. Can typically expect a usable power from a few milliwatts. To have more power, a second laser diode (slave), more powerful, can be injected by the first beam and then deliver tens of milliwatts. An acousto-optic modulator is used to produce light pulse duration and power controlled.
In order to avoid the inevitable leakage of light through the modulator, a mechanical shutter is used to cut the beam during periods of nonuse. Brrrrc




/ / / / / / / / / / / / Using the CCD as power meter / / / / / / / / / / / /

One final concerning the interpretation of the signal output by the CCD sensor. In normal operation, each pixel produces a signal proportional to aaaaq CCCSignal bbbbq light energy aaaaq CCCEpix bbbbq accumulated during exposure time aaaaq CCCTPulse bbbbq. However, we see later that the information we use in practice is the intensity distribution aaaaq CCCIxy bbbbq in the object plane of the optical system (where is the cloud). The CCD may well provide this information if we know the following parameters:
* The sensitivity of the sensor,
* Aaaaq CCCGrandis bbbbq magnification of the optical system that determines the surface that represents a pixel in the object plane,
* The duration of exposure aaaaq CCCTPulse bbbbq which determines the light power received,
* Losses and attenuations aaaaq CCCAttenOptique bbbbq on the beam path in the optical system, between the object plane and the sensor.

We shall denote by aaaaq I'CCCxpyp bbbbq the intensity distribution measured on the sensor. The intensity aaaaq CCCIxy bbbbq in the object plane is then deduced by the expression:

Throughout the remainder of this chapter, the signals from the CCD will be systematically interpreted in terms of intensity aaaaq CCCIxy bbbbq in the object plane.

/ / / / / / / / Interaction atom laser / / / / / / / /

To interpret the data acquired by optical methods, it is important to know the process of interaction between the atoms and the electromagnetic field.
The detailed description of these processes is beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, we recall some basic notions in the simple case of a two-level atom interacting with a coherent monochromatic light wave.
If experimentally relevant to an atom having an energy complex structure is discussed in laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: ipafosBrrrrc.

[[Image: AbsImaging-EnergieAtome2Niveaux.png | right | 700px]]
And we examine the interaction between the atoms in the cloud and the monochromatic light from a laser pulse aaaaq CCCpulsLaser bbbbq. We consider the simple case of an atom with two energy levels: the ground state by aaaaq CCCEtatG bbbbq and excited state aaaaq CCCEtatE bbbbq. Energy aaaaq CCCenergieGE bbbbq between these two levels is a resonant angular frequency

CCCRemarqueTitreBrrrroÉlargissement inhomogèneBrrrrcBrrrro
We neglect in the rest of the inhomogeneous broadening sources, that is to say, we will consider that the atoms of the cloud all react the same way towards the light. The resonance angular frequency aaaaq CCCpulsReso bbbbq is thus the same for all atoms. This implies in particular that:
* The temperature of the cloud is small compared with the Doppler temperature to get rid of the Doppler effect. For aaaaq POOOOOBrrrro87Brrrrc bbbbqRb, aaaaq CCCTDoppler CCCapprox CCCmicroKBrrrro146Brrrrc bbbbq.
* There is no significant gradient magnetic field on the spatial extension of the cloud.

More generally, any type of confinement (magnetic dipole, etc.) moving the energy levels of atoms, must be cut when taking pictures. This means that the cloud is then ballistic expansion.

Just remember that in the case considered here of a coherent light wave acting on a two-tier system, it is possible to describe the evolution of atomic populations and coherences through the optical Bloch equations. These are obtained by making several approximations that we recall here:
* Rotating field approximation
,
* The short memory approximation
,
* It is also assumed that all frequencies typical coupling between atom and field are negligible compared to the optical frequency
.

In the sequel, we will consider the steady

In the remainder of this chapter, unless otherwise stated, we will assume implicitly a laser wave with no disagreement: aaaaq CCCdesac bbbbq = 0. We will explain the reasons for this choice laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: ImagerieDesaccordeeBrrrrc.

We now consider a set of atomic atomic density aaaaq CCCdensxyz bbbbq subjected to a laser wave whose intensity distribution is aaaaq CCCIxyz bbbbq.

This expression is valid, for example, whether it is for a wave passing through the cloud, or to a standing wave produced by a set of laser beams.
Brrrrc




/ / / / Reliability of image capture / / / /


The measurement protocols described in the next section are the most destructive measures, that is to say, changing the properties of clouds whose image is made. Indeed, the absorption and scattering of photons, is changing the properties of the atomic cloud (size, temperature, CCCldots).
For this reason, it is often impossible to perform two successive measurements on the same cloud.
CCCRemarqueBrrrro
In the following (including laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: ipafosBrrrrc), when we propose to repeatedly image the same cloud, we must keep in mind that each measurement is actually performed on a different atomic cloud, but carefully prepared in the same experimental conditions. Good reproducibility of the experiment is then provided four CCCtextitBrrrrosine nonBrrrrc to ensure the production of repeated identical clouds.
Brrrrc


It is more important that the properties of the atomic cloud does not change significantly when taking a picture, otherwise the image is no longer usable. On this point, we propose in this section to discuss the reliability of an image taken in the case of a single laser pulse aaaaq CCCTPulse bbbbq illuminating a cloud. We assume for simplicity that the saturation parameter aaaaq CCCsat bbbbq is the same for each atom cloud.

/ / / / / / / / Diffusion due to thermal agitation / / / / / / / /

Before considering the effect of light on the external degrees of freedom of atoms, recall that, in most cases encountered, the confinement of the cloud is cut at the time of image acquisition. The ballistic expansion of the cloud while taking picture must be considered. Indeed, if we consider a cloud hdy balance defined by the temperature T aaaaq bbbbq, the mean square velocity of the atoms in the cloud is aaaaq CCCDv = CCCsqrtBrrrroCCCtfracBrrrroCCCkb SPACEFG TBrrrrcBrrrromBrrrrcBrrrrc bbbbq. Each atom moves on average
 of d = aaaaq CCCTPulse SPACEFG CCCDv bbbbq during the aaaaq CCCTPulse bbbbq pulse. The distance d aaaaq bbbbq is an upper bound on the spatial resolution that can be expected when taking a picture.
CCCApplicationNumeriqueBrrrro
Consider a cloud whose equilibrium temperature T = hdy is aaaaq CCCmicroKBrrrro100Brrrrc bbbbq. Calculate the maximum aaaaq CCCTPulse bbbbq compatible with diffusion of atomic positions below aaaaq d = ??CCCmicronBrrrro10Brrrrc bbbbq (this corresponds to the typical size aaaaq CCCLpix bbbbq represented by a CCD pixel in the object plane):

If this condition is true, each atom contributes, on average, more than one pixel on the CCD.
Brrrrc


/ / / / / / / / Acceleration due to radiation pressure / / / / / / / /

The first effect of the laser on the position and velocity of the atoms is the radiation pressure. This pushes the atoms in the direction of propagation of the laser wave. According to expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: PdifBrrrrc each atom absorbs (and diffuse in a random direction) an average number
aaaaq CCCtfracBrrrroCCCpulsSpontBrrrrcBrrrro2Brrrrc SPACEFG CCCtfracBrrrroCCCsatBrrrrcBrrrro1 + CCCsatBrrrrc bbbbq

CCCApplicationNumeriqueBrrrro
What condition must be fulfilled for a shift Doppler negligible compared to the natural width aaaaq CCCpulsSpont bbbbq transition? We can write:

where aaaaq CCClambda bbbbq is the wavelength of the laser. We thus obtain the condition on the duration aaaaq CCCTPulse bbbbq of the light pulse and saturation parameter aaaaq CCCsat bbbbq:

We can therefore allow very intense light pulses (1 aaaaq CCCsat CCCgtrsim bbbbq) whose duration is of the order of microseconds.

Brrrrc


/ / / / / / / / Heating due to spontaneous emission / / / / / / / /

The second effect is related to the re-emission of photons in random directions and tends to diffuse the velocity vectors of each atom. This translates into a warm cloud. In the notations used above, we express the rate of heating of the cloud during the light pulse:

/ / / / Imaging Techniques usual / / / /

Different techniques can be used to obtain a representative picture of the atomic density of the cloud. In this section, we present the two main methods currently used, then we mark the limits of the latter when it comes to produce images of dense clouds.


/ / / / / / / / Fluorescence Imaging / / / / / / / /

The technique that seems easiest to implement is simply CCCsotosayBrrrroéclairerBrrrrc the atomic cloud and collect the light scattered by it through the optical system. We speak fluorescence imaging.
As shown figureCCCnrefBrrrrofig: OptiqueFluoBrrrrc, the incident laser beam can not along the optical axis z aaaaq bbbbq so as not to hinder the detection of the light scattered by the cloud.

CCCCaptionFigssssBrrrroSchéma illustrating a simple optical system to image fluorescence. The incident laser beam can not along the optical axis z aaaaq bbbbq so as not to interfere with the detection of the light scattered by the cloud. We symbolically represented the spontaneous emission of a few photons. Only a fraction of these is emitted in the direction of the system optique.Brrrrc


The spontaneous emission of photons is isotropic and only a fraction of the scattered light is collected by the optical system. If aaaaq CCCRLentille bbbbq is the radius of the lens and the distance aaaaq CCCNuageLentille bbbbq cloud-lens, it is CCCsotosayBrrrrovueBrrrrc by the cloud as a solid angle:

Assuming that all the photons that reach the lens are sent to the CCD sensor, it measures a fraction aaaaq CCCtfracBrrrroCCCAngleSolideBrrrrcBrrrro4 SPACEFG CCCpiBrrrrc bbbbq of the light scattered by the cloud.

where aaaaq CCCIbackxy bbbbq means the intensity of the background light
which is measured by the CCD even in the absence of the cloud and aaaaq BrrrroCCCPdifBrrrrc bbbbq is the power light scattered by the cloud (see laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: PuissanceDiffuseeBrrrrc).
Note that the integral involved in the expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: IccdFluoPdifBrrrrc reflects the fact that each point aaaaq CCCxyz bbbbq cloud has a aaaaq CCCxy bbbbq image on the CCD.

This relationship involves the local light intensity aaaaq CCCIxyz bbbbq through the saturation parameter aaaaq CCCsat bbbbq. But in practice, this intensity is not uniform in space for two reasons:
* The transverse profile of the laser intensity is never completely uniform,
* Laser intensity decreases during its propagation through the cloud.

It is difficult, from the signal aaaaq CCCIccdxy bbbbq, extract quantitative information on the atomic density aaaaq CCCdensxyz bbbbq.

In practice, the usual technique of fluorescence imaging is to consider that the entire cloud is subjected to the same light intensity. We can write the equation:

Typically CCCvalBrrrroE9Brrrrc atoms are illuminated by six laser beams of magneto-optical trap whose disagreement aaaaq CCCdesacCCCapprox-3 SPACEFG CCCpulsSpont bbbbq.Brrrrc



To estimate the saturation parameter aaaaq CCCsat_0 bbbbq which corresponds to the figureCCCnrefBrrrrofig: ImagesFluoBrrrrc, we consider the following parameters:
* 6 laser beams are involved, * intensity is about aaaaq ICCCapprox2 SPACEFG CCCIsat bbbbq,
* Beams is disagreement aaaaq CCCdesacCCCapprox-3 SPACEFG CCCpulsSpont bbbbq,
* We neglect the magnetic field inhomogeneity.

According to expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: ParamSatBrrrrc, we deduce aaaaq CCCsat_0 CCCapprox CCCvalBrrrro0.3Brrrrc bbbbq.


/ / / / / / / / / / / / Measurement protocol for imaging fluorescence / / / / / / / / / / / /


The expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: IccdFluoApproxBrrrrc therefore contains a background signal aaaaq CCCIbackxy bbbbq, and a useful signal, proportional to the density column. In practice, it overcomes the first term in capturing not one, but two images on the CCD.
* The first is an image of the atomic cloud in the presence of laser light excitation, the signal collected corresponds to the expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: IccdFluoBrrrrc
* The second is an image taken under the same conditions but in the absence of cloud, the measured signal is then composed only of the term aaaaq CCCIccdxy = CCCIbackxy bbbbq.

The usual technique absorption imaging is to use a resonant laser beam (aaaaq CCCdesac bbbbq = 0), and the intensity of which is small compared to the saturation intensity. We then speak imaging absorption in the low saturation regime. In this limit, we can consider that atoms have a linear response to the laser intensity.
The expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: dIabsGeneraleBrrrrc with aaaaq CCCsatCCCll bbbbq allows one to obtain the linear differential equation of first order:

At the theoretical study of fluorescence imaging protocol (CCCautorefBrrrrosec: ipfBrrrrc), we have implicitly made an important simplifying assumption. It is assumed that all photons emitted spontaneously in the cloud can reach the CCD with the same probability.
In reality, there may be a scattered photon by an atom is immediately re-absorbed into the cloud by another atom.
[[Image: AbsImaging-EmissionRéabsorption.png | right | 700px]]

This means that the optical system can be observed that the apparent surface of the cloud.

We can identify two behaviors limits depending on the characteristic size of the cloud aaaaq CCCLZnuage bbbbq along the optical axis:
* If aaaaq CCCDlibreCCCggCCCLZnuage bbbbq, then a photon will have little chance of being re-absorbed in the cloud

/ / / / / / / / / / / / Fluorescence imaging system is extremely saturating / / / / / / / / / / / /

The team D.Weiss (Berkeley, California) has implemented a protocol for fluorescence imaging in a regime of extreme saturation to consider a compressed magneto-optical trap atoms CésiumCCCciteBrrrroDLH00Brrrrc. It uses a laser Titanium Sapphire delivering CCCSIBrrrro500BrrrrcBrrrroCCCmilliCCCwattBrrrrc resonant light. The laser imager is retro-reflected to balance radiative forces induced by the absorption of photons repeated. With an imaging beam whose radius aaaaq CCCtfracBrrrro1BrrrrcBrrrroCCCexpoBrrrro2BrrrrcBrrrrc bbbbq of CCCmmBrrrro4Brrrrc, it is possible to obtain currents of up to aaaaq CCCvalBrrrro2000Brrrrc SPACEFG CCCIsat bbbbq.

The use of such intensities is very interesting in many ways on the physical plane:
* Aaaaq CCCPopuE bbbbq population of the excited state is very close
its limiting value aaaaq CCCPopuEmax = CCCtfracBrrrro1BrrrrcBrrrro2Brrrrc bbbbq. Thus, each average atom emits aaaaq CCCtfracBrrrroCCCpulsSpontBrrrrcBrrrro2Brrrrc bbbbq photons per second, regardless of fluctuations in the local intensity of the laser beam. The measures are quantitative.
* The saturation parameter aaaaq CCCsat bbbbq is large compared to unity, even if the laser is not perfectly resonant. This method is thus insensitive to the disagreement of the laser or the presence of magnetic field gradient. In particular it is operable to perform an image of a magneto-optical trap.
* Cross section aaaaq CCCseceffsat bbbbq saturated transition is very low (see CCCvpagerefBrrrrosec: ReAbsorptionBrrrrc). Thus, the measured optical densities are much higher. Another physical interpretation of this phenomenon is that the process of re-absorption within the cloud are offset by the process of stimulated emission, since the population aaaaq CCCPopuE bbbbq of the excited state is almost identical to the population of aaaaq CCCPopuG bbbbq the ground state.

The technique described in the référenceCCCciteBrrrroDLH00Brrrrc is accurate, robust and allowed the group to measure D.Weiss CCCdo the order of CCCvalBrrrro100Brrrrc.

However, if the cloud CCCdo is important, then the value of the intensity aaaaq CCCIout bbbbq after crossing the cloud can become extremely low
 relative to the incident intensity aaaaq CCCIin bbbbq. In other words, the cloud can absorb almost all incident light.

We will show that this is a real problem with measuring the CCD.
To make best use of the full range of possible values ??for the signal aaaaq CCCSignalCCCxy bbbbq,
we set the optical system so that the value aaaaq CCCSignalMax bbbbq corresponds to the maximum intensity of the laser imager when it is not absorbed, that is to say:

This imaging technique on an open transition has two major advantages:
* It is quantitative in the sense that the number of photons absorbed accurately reflects the number of atoms in the cloud.
* It is more robustness. Indeed, the presence of magnetic field gradient, or any other source of widening the transition cyclante not modify in any way the quantitative nature of this technique.



The main disadvantage of this method lies in the weakness of the signals to be measured as the number of photons absorbed per unit area of ??the imaging beam is only twice the density of the cloud column.

Consider a practical example to show that the absorption signal on an open transition is very low. A cloud of atoms can absorb typically CCCvalBrrrroE9Brrrrc CCCvalBrrrro2E9Brrrrc photons. If we consider that the transverse size

/ / / / Imaging absorption in the regime of strong saturation / / / /

In this section, we describe the absorption imaging protocol that we have developed in order to acquire and exploit quantitatively, images of dense atomic ensembles.
We begin by giving some arguments that challenge the quantitative imaging low absorption saturation described in laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: ipafasBrrrrc. It is indeed quite sensitive to experimental imperfections.

/ / / / / / / / Position of the problem / / / / / / / /

Let us define an important point about the quantitative nature of the low saturation absorption imaging. We specified a definite advantage of this method is that the sensitivity of the CCD, and the characteristics of the transition (aaaaq CCCIsat bbbbq and aaaaq CCCseceff bbbbq) does not need to be known to give quantitative measures of CCCdo (see expression CCCvrefBrrrroeq: DensColAbsorptionBrrrrc). However, it is necessary to know precisely the cross section aaaaq CCCseceff bbbbq transition to calculate the column density aaaaq CCCdenscolCCCxy bbbbq, size of interest.

but this is true only in the case where the laser light is perfectly circularly polarized aaaaq CCCsigmaPOOOOOBrrrro-Brrrrc bbbbq.


In addition, other experimental imperfections can alter the character of the absorbing atomic medium. One can for example concern:
* The laser pulse imager is not exactly at resonance (aaaaq CCCdesac CCCneq bbbbq 0)
* That the spectral width of the laser is non-negligible compared to the natural width aaaaq CCCpulsSpont bbbbq transition,
* A residual magnetic field moves the sub-niveauBrrrroxBrrrrc Zeeman, implying that the imaging laser becomes non-resonant.

In addition, if the laser pulse is very short, and the number of photons absorbed per atom is of the order of ten, one must consider the transient optical Bloch equations. The initial distribution of the populations of Zeeman sub-niveauBrrrroxBrrrrc plays an important role in absorption.

CCCRemarqueBrrrro
Note that the effect of experimental imperfections is always to decrease the absorption of light.
Brrrrc



We propose in the remainder of this chapter to answer this question. We describe the experimental imperfections by a correction parameter, then we present our imaging protocol to measure this parameter and interpret quantitative images of dense atomic clouds.

Note that aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq is a priori situation-specific experimental data, that is to say, it must be determined in a systematic way to exploit the images taken by absorption.



The problem is the following:
We will show in the following that the answer to this question CCCldots is non-linear.

/ / / / / / / / Reply nonlinear atoms / / / / / / / /

We saw in laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: LimiteIpafasBrrrrc the limit of imaging protocol weakly saturated absorption lies in the fact that the laser light can be extremely attenuated when passing through the cloud. This is mainly due to the exponential nature of the Beer-Lambert law (see equation linear differential CCCvrefBrrrroeq: EqDiffAbsBasseIntBrrrrc).

One can overcome this limitation by using the non-linear response of the atoms to a laser excitation, that is to say, by saturating the transition. For this, we use higher laser intensities. This is called imaging absorption in the regime of strong saturation.

Recall that in the general case, the evolution of the laser intensity during the propagation in the cloud is given by the differential equation non-linéaireCCCnrefBrrrroeq: EqDiffAbsGeneraleBrrrrc. Thereof, in the case of a resonant laser (aaaaq CCCdesac bbbbq = 0), and taking into account the correction parameter aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq, is written:

This expression is valid for any value of the intensity aaaaq CCCIxyz bbbbq, unlike the expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: EqDiffAbsBasseIntBrrrrc, which is valid only in the limit of low intensities.

The équationCCCnrefBrrrroeq: EqDiffAbsResonanceBrrrrc fits by separation of variables and to calculate the column density aaaaq CCCdenscolxy bbbbq from measuring aaaaq CCCIinxy bbbbq, aaaaq CCCIoutxy bbbbq and aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq, without assuming that the intensity is low to aaaaq CCCIsat bbbbq:

We must emphasize two important points related to the use of expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: DensColAbsHighIntResonanceBrrrrc to operate the imaging absorption in the regime of strong saturation:
* It is necessary to calibrate the sensitivity of the CCD sensor to measure absolute
Unlike aaaaq CCCIinxy - CCCIoutxy bbbbq. Each pixel of the CCD then serves power meter. This requires perfectly calibrate losses and attenuations aaaaq CCCAttenOptique bbbbq involved in the path of the laser beam in the optical system between the cloud and the sensor (see laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: SystOptiqueBrrrrc).
* Expression of the column density relationCCCnrefBrrrroeq: DensColAbsHighIntResonanceBrrrrc is noteworthy because it contains two terms, one of which involves only the correction parameter aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq. It is this property that allows us to determine the latter.





ResultatsBrrrro
Optical depth aaaaq CCCOptProfCCCxyImperf bbbbq seems to depend correction parameter. There is nothing, as we outlined in laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: ipafasBrrrrc, the optical depth = aaaaq CCCOptProf CCCOptProfExpr bbbbq is a characteristic of the cloud, independent of the measurement. Parameter aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq is the value for which the expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: DensColAbsHighIntResonanceBrrrrc gives the optical depth. This is an experimental parameter, as well as aaaaq CCCIinxy bbbbq and aaaaq CCCIoutxy bbbbq.

CCCsubsection [Protocol measurement and determination of the correction parameter] BrrrroProtocole measurement and determination of the correction parameter aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbqBrrrrc

Now describe the protocol that we have developed to carry out the measurement of density of an atomic cloud column density. To make this statement more concrete, we will support our reasoning with experimental data.
CCCRemarqueBrrrro
The atomic cloud that will be discussed in the following is obtained by loading the magneto-optical trap described in laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: PaquetsPmoBrrrrc. Column density of the cloud is voluntarily taken low (aaaaq CCCsimeq bbbbq 3) in order to compare our technique to its counterpart low intensity. An example image of dense atomic cloud is given in laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: ImageNuageDenseBrrrrc.
Brrrrc



The image of the cloud is done, as in laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: ipafasBrrrrc, using 3 images (an image with the cloud, one without the cloud, and an image of the background light). We take a whole series of images of clouds prepared under identical conditions, but using different incident laser intensities aaaaq CCCIin bbbbq. The range of values ??used to aaaaq CCCIin bbbbq typically lasts about 1 aaaaq bbbbq or aaaaq bbbbq two orders of magnitude. For our experimental example (see Figure CCCvrefBrrrrofig: PleinImagesNuageBrrrrc), we use eight values ??ranging from aaaaq CCCIin CCCapprox CCCtfracBrrrroCCCIsatBrrrrcBrrrro20Brrrrc CCCapprox CCCmWpcmcBrrrro0.09Brrrrc bbbbq and aaaaq CCCIin = 10 CCCIsat CCCtimes CCCapprox CCCmWpcmcBrrrro18Brrrrc bbbbq.

* The first term (log) is a decreasing function of the incident intensity aaaaq CCCIin bbbbq,
* The other end (differential) is an increasing function of the incident intensity aaaaq CCCIin bbbbq.





ResultatsBrrrro
The idea is as follows:
* For a single cloud, we have different frames, which must, however, possible to calculate all the same optical depth by expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: DensColAbsHighIntResonanceBrrrrc since it makes no assumption about the incident intensity of the laser,
* Or the two terms of this expression are involved with different weights, and the first one involves the correction parameter aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq.

We deduce that there is only one possible value for aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq that reconciles all images.
Brrrrc



To illustrate this, suppose the space of a moment that aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq = 1, that is to say, the experimental situation corresponds exactly to the theoretical case of a two-level atom subject to a laser wave resonator.
[[Image: AbsImaging-AllureAlphaEgal1.png | right | 700px]]
In this case, the images that are subject to the figureCCCnrefBrrrrofig: PleinImagesNuageBrrrrc do not all have the same value of the optical depth. The figure represents the optical depth against aaaaq CCCOptProfMax bbbbq cloud
depending aaaaq CCCIin bbbbq, average value of the laser intensity. The saturation intensity is indicated by a dotted line. The error bars are obtained by performing each action a dozen times.
The growth curve shows that, assuming aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq = 1, we underestimate the decreasing term (log) of expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: DensColAbsHighIntResonanceBrrrrc. This therefore means queaaaaq CCCImperf> 1 bbbbq.


/ / / / / / / / / / / / Adjust the correction parameter / / / / / / / / / / / /

To determine aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq, we consider it as a variable, which we denote adjustable aaaaq CCCImperfVarie bbbbq.

CCCRemarqueBrrrro
We use this notation in order not to confuse the adjustable variable aaaaq CCCImperfVarie bbbbq with CCCsotosayBrrrrovraieBrrrrc value aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq. In other words, aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq is the particular value of the correction parameter which should be adjusted on aaaaq CCCImperfVarie bbbbq.
Brrrrc



As in the previous example (we considered the ideal case aaaaq CCCImperfVarie bbbbq = 1), we calculate the optical depth aaaaq CCCOptProfCCCxyImperfVarie bbbbq by expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: DensColAbsHighIntResonanceBrrrrc for each intensity aaaaq CCCIin bbbbq used.
Recall that aaaaq CCCOptProf bbbbq is a physical characteristic of the cloud and does not depend on how we practice the measurement. In other words, for all incident intensities used, we expect to obtain the same optical depth by expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: DensColAbsHighIntResonanceBrrrrc.
The figureCCCnrefBrrrrofig: PleinAlphaCourbeBrrrrc represents some of the curves obtained by using different values ??for the parameters aaaaq CCCImperfVarie bbbbq.

Each curve corresponds to a different value of the correction parameter aaaaq CCCImperfVarie bbbbq used when calculating the expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: DensColAbsHighIntResonanceBrrrrc.

Finally summarize the main advantages of our imaging protocol absorption in the regime of strong saturation:
* Optical system needed to apply this method is quite standard and does not require heavy equipment. It is likely that any device for making images taken by absorption in the low saturation regime can be immediately adapted to carry our protocol.
* The use of laser intensities above the saturation intensity overcomes the problems associated with almost complete absorption of the laser light by an optically thick cloud (aaaaq CCCOptProf> 5 bbbbq). We can observe very high optical depths where low intensity imaging is ineffective (see laCCCautorefBrrrrosec: LimiteIpafasBrrrrc).

* Determination of the correction parameter aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq can use the images quantitatively by absorption. It should also be noted that the measurements on optically less dense atomic clouds (which can be imaged by the usual technique in weakly saturating regime) should always take into account the value of the correction parameter aaaaq CCCImperf bbbbq. Let us recall that it intervenes in the calculation of column density (see expressionCCCnrefBrrrroeq: DensColAbsHighIntResonanceBrrrrc).
